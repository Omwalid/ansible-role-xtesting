# By default all jobs in one step are executed in parallel and they will be
# all executed before a failure occurs. The next ones will be cancelled here
# (see abort-all-job: true). Then it continues to the second step here as the
# condition to next phase is always.
# It must be noted that the tests are executed randomly in a step.
